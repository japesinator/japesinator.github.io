<h1 id="a_personal_update">A Personal Update</h1>

<p>I don’t mean to become the person from <a href="https://xkcd.com/621/">the XKCD</a>, but I will apologize for not posting much lately. I’ve been really busy with a few projects which I hope to post about soon, but in short:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>On the Boy Scouting front, I’m now director of STEM at <a href="http://isrsummercamp.org/">Ingersoll Scout Reservation</a>. Since this is a new area this year, I’m designing a bunch of material to teach important things but still be as accessible as possible to people without much high school math or even electricity. I’m now Vice Chief of Administration for <a href="http://wq23.org/">Wenasa Quenhotan Lodge</a>, so I’ll be managing some financial things and setting up some new technology</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>On the academic side of things, I’ve been working on a project to produce a paper about UAVs. I’ll probably be working on implementing some crypto that can resist both smart attackers with fast computers and the kind of packet loss you get when your only communication method is wireless to a drone 100 meters in the air. Also, I’ve been doing a bunch of stuff with <a href="isusec.com">ISUSec</a>, where I’ve been presenting about crypto and reverse engineering.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>On the personal side of things, I’ve been taking a couple courses at <a href="http://coursera.org">Coursera</a> in Cryptography and Machine Learning, and have been writing a tic-tac-toe AI and a (somewhat) R5RS compliant scheme in Haskell.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>So essentially, I’ve been really busy, but for good reasons, and I’ll post more soon.</p>
