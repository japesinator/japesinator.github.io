          <h1>The 2014 Smith Family Christmas Letter</h1>
<span class="time">22 Nov 2014</span>

<div class="content">
	<div class="post"><p>This year my parents requested I write the family Christmas letter. This was a
terrible idea.  Without further ado:</p>

<h1>The Smith Family Christmas Letter 2014</h1>

<p>Hello friends, family, and people we don&#39;t know but would feel bad not sending
a Christmas letter to because, y&#39;know, you sent us one!</p>

<p>We hope you&#39;ve had a wonderful year, since we know we have.  All six of our
children (don&#39;t worry if you thought we only had five, we briefly forgot too)
have really grown up this year, and in fact so have we!</p>

<h2>Jamie</h2>

<p>As it turns out, the difference between the stress of managing five children
and the stress of managing six (see below) is enough to drive even the most
devoted mother from her home, and into the opium dens of Calcutta, where Jamie
now resides.  The new, remote location, along with the vivid visions induced by
said opium add some new challenges to parenting, but on the other hand, a total
divorce from reality really does make coping with things like sudden child
transformation much easier.</p>

<h2>Martin</h2>

<p>This year, we finally found out Martin was actually two identical twins playing
a very involved prank.  They had spent decades pretending to be one person, and
had even gotten married before finally being caught together discussing the
day&#39;s event this Spring.  Of course, what others would call &quot;indications of
possible mental illness&quot; or &quot;completely insane&quot; the Smith family calls
&quot;endearing&quot; and both twins now live with us, having been duly congratulated for
their (admittedly impressive) practical joke.</p>

<h2>JP</h2>

<p>&quot;JP &#39;rap game Sylvia Plath&#39; Smith&quot; is quickly becoming a household name (largely
due to his practice of actually breaking into households), and has even appeared
on some notable TV shows like &quot;Emergency Crime Bulletin&quot; and &quot;The FBI&#39;s Top Ten
Most Wanted&quot;.  As a wise man once said, there&#39;s no such thing as bad publicity,
and JP plans to leverage this newfound fame and glory to become the world&#39;s
best-known aquarium guru and thus achieve one of his many life goals.</p>

<h2>Andrew</h2>

<p>Andrew is just at a sleepover at a friends house and we decline to answer any
more questions without a lawyer.</p>

<h2>Wilfred</h2>

<p>After years of searching, and some skepticism as to his existence, Wilfred Smith
was finally tracked down (he was hiding under a rug) and returned to the Smith
family.  As you might imagine, there was some catching up to do after an absence
of almost a decade, but in the end, no hard feelings were had and we are again
growing closer as a family (and cleaning beneath our rugs more than once every
ten years)</p>

<h2>Eliot</h2>

<p>Eliot began this year by consuming a big gulp full of five-hour energy shots,
and shortly after became a being of pure energy and was assumed into the astral
plane.  This has unique benefits (lack of hunger or thirst, eldritch knowledge
of that which is totally alien to mankind, cool lights) but also some downsides
(being trapped on a different plane from everyone and everything he has ever
known or cared about).  All-in-all, we would describe it as a mixed blessing.</p>

<h2>☭</h2>

<p>The child we had previously called Ben has now changed his name to ☭ (UTF-8
e298ad) in keeping with his new, radically communist, political philosophy.  He
has also annexed several local farms to create a workers&#39; paradise, and, apart
from a few minor gulag issues, seems to be doing quite well for himself.  We
hope that he continues his newfound interest in political science well into
college, although according to the newspapers we found from his new country he
has already received at least seven Ph. D.&#39;s (various sources differ on the
exact number).</p>

<h2>Eleanor</h2>

<p>Eleanor has greatly changed following a brief trip to Chicago&#39;s &quot;O Block.&quot;
She now listens to the music of one &quot;Chief Keef&quot; a minimum of twenty hours a
day (often forgoing sleep to do so), requests &quot;lean&quot; with dinner (we are
currently unaware of what this is, although apparently it is not available at
our local Kroger), and has been implicated in at least one shooting (again, we
decline to answer more questions of this nature without a lawyer present). We&#39;re
really happy she is finally finding her own path, and are fully convinced she
can beat the biased and unfair charges leveled against her by an uncaring
court system.</p>

<hr>

<p>Well, that&#39;s our year!  We hope you have a great year, and please, if, during
your end-of-the-year giving you should recall some favor we have done you in the
past or otherwise feel generous, make out any and all checks to the Eleanor
Smith legal defense fund.</p>

<p>Regards,</p>
