About Me
========

* My name is JP.

* I go to highschool and a little bit of college in a medium-sized town in the midwest.

* I like math, computers, music, the outdoors, physics, and a bunch of other things, some of which I write about.

* I like to use Python and Haskell for most programming things, but I'm not opposed to anything else and I'd definitely like to add to that list in the near future.

* If you want to get in touch with me, email, irc, carrier pigeon and smoke signals are my preferred methods of communication.
